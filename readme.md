# Arduino library for ST Microelectronics M95M04 SPI EEPROM

This is a simple library for the [ST Microelectronics M95M04 SPI EEPROM](https://www.st.com/en/memories/m95m04-dr.html. Forked from stefandz/M95M01

Not all functions are covered in this library - just read and write (for bytes and byte arrays). I'll be trying to adjust the library for the 4Mbit version of the EEPROM and to implement the whole function spectrum.
